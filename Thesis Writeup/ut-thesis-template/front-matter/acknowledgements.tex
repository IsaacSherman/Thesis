\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my graduate committee for their support and help in this project.  I'd also like to thank Mark Slemp and Joe Vrba, without whom the necessary research never would have taken place.  I want to thank Dr. Catherine Schuman for her inspiring me to pursue evolutionary computation. I would like to thank Dr. Hairong Qi for her support and for teaching me everything I never wanted to know about Bayes' rule.  I want to thank Dr. Bruce MacLennan for being a patient, great advisor- he's everything a professor should be.
\\I want to thank my graduate discussion group for their insights and patience with my derailing of the meetings into weird philosophical tangents: Dr. Zahra Mahoor, Alan McBride, Casey Miller, Aaron Mishtal, Todd Young, Jonathon Ferrell, Camille Crumpton, and Andrew August.  You were the highlight of my week for most of my time as a graduate student, and without the public shaming of my peers I don't know how much of this work would have ever been completed.\\
I'd like to thank my family for their support of and patience with me.  In general, not just during grad school.  Thank you Monica and Darlene LaVerdure for all your help with everything in the past two years.  Thank you Anna and Daniel Fredette for helping keep my kid occupied on the weekends.  Thanks to my Mom and Sarah for listening to me complain about technical details you couldn't have possibly understood but for letting me work the problem out with you. \\
Lastly, but certainly not least, let me thank David and Zach for not being too terribly difficult to parent, and thank you Shannon for being amazing in every way.
