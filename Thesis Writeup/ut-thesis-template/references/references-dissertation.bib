	abstract = {Correlation analysis can reveal the complex relationships that often exist among the variables in multivariate data. However, as the number of variables grows, it can be difficult to gain a good understanding of the correlation landscape and important intricate relationships might be missed. We previously introduced a technique that arranged the variables into a 2D layout, encoding their pairwise correlations. We then used this layout as a network for the interactive ordering of axes in parallel coordinate displays. Our current work expresses the layout as a correlation map and employs it for visual correlation analysis. In contrast to matrix displays where correlations are indicated at intersections of rows and columns, our map conveys correlations by spatial proximity which is more direct and more focused on the variables in play. We make the following new contributions, some unique to our map: (1) we devise mechanisms that handle both categorical and numerical variables within a unified framework, (2) we achieve scalability for large numbers of variables via a multi-scale semantic zooming approach, (3) we provide interactive techniques for exploring the impact of value bracketing on correlations, and (4) we visualize data relations within the sub-spaces spanned by correlated variables by projecting the data into a corresponding tessellation of the map.},

	abstract = {In an extremely competitive marketplace, it is increasingly important for online travel agencies (OTAs) to understand customer satisfaction of different segments. The survey method has been widely used to gain such understanding. However, few previous studies on the tourism and hospitality business have proposed intelligent solutions to analyze such survey data to understand customer preferences on different criteria for different segments, and to determine how customers obtain overall satisfaction across different criteria. In this study, we follow a design-science research paradigm to develop a genetic algorithm-based learning approach to understand customer satisfaction and their psychometric reasons. We further validate this approach through an empirical study for evaluating OTA websites. The results show that different customer segments have different opinions on the importance of various evaluation criteria. The results also reveal that customers tend to judge OTA websites in terms of certain important criteria, instead of by the weighted average of every factor concerned. The proposed approach and the findings of this study can provide constructive suggestions to practitioners and researchers for developing customized marketing campaigns and improving the services of OTA websites.},

But secured data communication over internet and any other network is always under threat of intrusions and misuses. So Intrusion Detection Systems have become a needful component in terms of computer and network security. There are various approaches being utilized in intrusion detections, but unfortunately any of the systems so far is not completely flawless. So, the quest of betterment continues. In this progression, here we present an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), by applying genetic algorithm (GA) to efficiently detect various types of network intrusions. Parameters and evolution processes for GA are discussed in details and implemented. This approach uses evolution theory to information evolution in order to filter the traffic data and thus reduce the complexity. To implement and measure the performance of our system we used the KDD99 benchmark dataset and obtained reasonable detection rate.},

	abstract = {The solution of the inverse kinematics problem is fundamental in robot control. Many traditional inverse kinematics problem solutions, such as the geometric, iterative, and algebraic approaches, are inadequate for redundant robots. Recently, much attention has been focused on a neural-network-based inverse kinematics problem solution in robotics. However, the precision of the result obtained from a neural network requires improvement for certain sensitive tasks. In this paper, neural network and genetic algorithms are used together to solve the inverse kinematics problem of a six-joint Stanford robotic manipulator to minimize the error at the end effector. The proposed hybrid approach combines the characteristics of neural networks and evolutionary techniques to obtain more precise solutions. Three Elman neural networks were trained using separate training sets because one of the sets yields better results than the other two. The floating-point portions of each network were placed in the initial population of the genetic algorithm with the floating-point portions from randomly generated solutions. The end-effector position error was defined as the fitness function, and the genetic algorithm was implemented. Using this approach, the floating-point portion of the neural-network result was improved by up to ten significant digits using a genetic algorithm, and the error was reduced to micrometer levels. These results were compared with those from studies in the literature and found to be significantly better.},

	abstract = {We investigated whether the covert orienting of visuospatial attention can be effectively used in a brain-computer interface guided by event-related potentials. Three visual interfaces were tested: one interface that activated voluntary orienting of visuospatial attention and two interfaces that elicited automatic orienting of visuospatial attention. We used two epoch classification procedures. The online epoch classification was performed via Independent Component Analysis, and then it was followed by fixed features extraction and support vector machines classification. The offline epoch classification was performed by means of a genetic algorithm that permitted us to retrieve the relevant features of the signal, and then to categorise the features with a logistic classifier. The offline classification, but not the online one, allowed us to differentiate between the performances of the interface that required voluntary orienting of visuospatial attention and those that required automatic orienting of visuospatial attention. The offline classification revealed an advantage of the participants in using the “voluntary” interface. This advantage was further supported, for the first time, by neurophysiological data. Moreover, epoch analysis was performed better with the “genetic algorithm classifier” than with the “independent component analysis classifier”. We suggest that the combined use of voluntary orienting of visuospatial attention and of a classifier that permits feature extraction ad personam (i.e., genetic algorithm classifier) can lead to a more efficient control of visual BCIs.},

CTG recordings consist of fetal heart rate (FHR) and the uterine contraction (UC) signals and are widely used by obstetricians for assessing fetal well-being. Features extracted from normal and pathological FHR and UC signals were used to construct an SVM based classifier. The GA was then used to find the optimal feature subset that maximizes the classification performance of the SVM based normal and pathological CTG classifier. An extensive clinical CTG data, classified by three expert obstetricians, was used to test the performance of the new scheme. It was demonstrated that the new scheme was able to predict the fetal state as normal or pathological with 99.3 \% and 100 \% accuracy, respectively. The results reveal that, the GA can be used to determine the critical features to be used in evaluating fetal well-being and consequently increase the classification performance. When compared to widely used ANN and ANFIS based methods, the proposed scheme performed considerably better.},

	abstract = {The development of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is of high interest to many governmental and military organizations around the world. An essential aspect of UAV autonomy is the ability for automatic path planning. In this paper, we use the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to cope with the complexity of the problem and compute feasible and quasi-optimal trajectories for fixed wing UAVs in a complex 3D environment, while considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle. The characteristics of the optimal path are represented in the form of a multiobjective cost function that we developed. The paths produced are composed of line segments, circular arcs and vertical helices. We reduce the execution time of our solutions by using the “single-program, multiple-data” parallel programming paradigm and we achieve real-time performance on standard commercial off-the-shelf multicore CPUs. After achieving a quasi-linear speedup of 7.3 on 8 cores and an execution time of 10 s for both algorithms, we conclude that by using a parallel implementation on standard multicore CPUs, real-time path planning for UAVs is possible. Moreover, our rigorous comparison of the two algorithms shows, with statistical significance, that the GA produces superior trajectories to the PSO.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the capacitated minimum spanning tree (CMST) problem. Given a central processor and a set of remote terminals with specified demands for traffic that must flow between the central processor and terminals, the goal is to design a minimum cost network to carry this demand. Potential links exist between any pair of terminals and between the central processor and the terminals. Each potential link can be included in the design at a given cost. The CMST problem is to design a minimum-cost network connecting the terminals with the central processor so that the flow on any arc of the network is at most Q. A biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) is a metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization which evolves a population of random vectors that encode solutions to the combinatorial optimization problem. This paper explores several solution encodings as well as different strategies for some steps of the algorithm and finally proposes a BRKGA heuristic for the CMST problem. Computational experiments are presented showing the effectiveness of the approach: Seven new best-known solutions are presented for the set of benchmark instances used in the experiments.},

	abstract = {The overall aim of the software industry is to ensure delivery of high quality software to the end user. To ensure high quality software, it is required to test software. Testing ensures that software meets user specifications and requirements. However, the field of software testing has a number of underlying issues like effective generation of test cases, prioritisation of test cases etc which need to be tackled. These issues demand on effort, time and cost of the testing. Different techniques and methodologies have been proposed for taking care of these issues. Use of evolutionary algorithms for automatic test generation has been an area of interest for many researchers. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one such form of evolutionary algorithms. In this research paper, we present a survey of GA approach for addressing the various issues encountered during software testing.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an effective hybrid optimization strategy by incorporating the adaptive optimization of particle swarm optimization (PSO) into genetic algorithm (GA), namely HPSOGA, is used for determining the parameters of radial basis function neural networks (number of neurons, their respective centers and radii) automatically. While this task depends upon operator׳s experience with trial and error due to lack of prior knowledge, or based on gradient algorithms which are highly dependent on initial values. In this paper, hybrid evolutionary algorithms are used to automatically build a radial basis function neural networks (RBF-NN) that solves a specified problem, related to rainfall forecasting in this case. In HPSOGA, individuals in a new generation are created through three approaches to improve the global optimization performance, which are elitist strategy, PSO strategy and GA strategy. The upper-half of the best-performing individuals in a population are regarded as elites, whereas the half of the worst-performing individuals are regarded as a swarm. The group constituted by the elites are enhanced by selection, crossover and mutation operation on these enhanced elites. HPSOGA is applied to RBF-NN design for rainfall prediction. The performance of HPSOGA is compared to pure GA in these basis function neural networks design problems, showing that the hybrid strategy is of more effective global exploration ability and to avoid premature convergence. Our findings reveal that the hybrid optimization strategy proposed here may be used as a promising alternative forecasting tool for higher forecasting accuracy and better generalization ability.},

CellNet utilizes a new genetic operator designed to facilitate a canalization of development: Merger. CellNet utilizes our own set of arbitrarily chosen features, and is applied to the CEDAR Database of handwritten Latin characters, as well as to a database of handwritten Indian digits provided by CENPARMI. CellNet's cooperative co-evolutionary approach shows significant improvement over a more standard Genetic Algorithm, both in terms of efficiency and in nearly eliminating over-fitting (to the training set). Additionally, the binary classifiers autonomously evolved by CellNet return validation accuracies approaching 98\% for both Latin and Indian digits, with no global changes to the system between the two trials.},

Particularly, the SVM mainly provides learning and curve fitting while the fmGA optimizes SVM parameters. Measures in term of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve and synthesis index are used for performance evaluation of proposed hybrid intelligence classification model. Experimental comparisons indicate that GASVM achieves better cross-fold prediction accuracy compared to other baseline models (i.e., CART, CHAID, QUEST, and C5.0) and previous works.

	abstract = {Classification is an important task in chemometrics. For several years now, support vector machines (SVMs) have proven to be powerful for infrared spectral data classification. However such methods require optimisation of parameters in order to control the risk of overfitting and the complexity of the boundary. Furthermore, it is established that the prediction ability of classification models can be improved using pre-processing in order to remove unwanted variance in the spectra. In this paper we propose a new methodology based on genetic algorithm (GA) for the simultaneous optimisation of SVM parameters and pre-processing (GENOPT-SVM). The method has been tested for the discrimination of the geographical origin of Italian olive oil (Ligurian and non-Ligurian) on the basis of near infrared (NIR) or mid infrared (FTIR) spectra. Different classification models (PLS-DA, SVM with mean centre data, GENOPT-SVM) have been tested and statistically compared using McNemar’s statistical test. For the two datasets, SVM with optimised pre-processing give models with higher accuracy than the one obtained with PLS-DA on pre-processed data. In the case of the NIR dataset, most of this accuracy improvement (86.3\% compared with 82.8\% for PLS-DA) occurred using only a single pre-processing step. For the FTIR dataset, three optimised pre-processing steps are required to obtain SVM model with significant accuracy improvement (82.2\%) compared to the one obtained with PLS-DA (78.6\%). Furthermore, this study demonstrates that even SVM models have to be developed on the basis of well-corrected spectral data in order to obtain higher classification rates.},

The second stage employs latent semantic indexing (LSI) empowered by genetic algorithm such that a better projection is attained using appropriate singular vectors, which are not limited to the ones corresponding to the largest singular values, unlike standard LSI approach. In this way, the singular vectors with small singular values may also be used for projection whereas the vectors with large singular values may be eliminated as well to obtain better discrimination. Experimental results demonstrate that GALSF outperforms both LSI and filter-based feature selection methods on benchmark datasets for various feature dimensions.},

However, the authentication and quality control of Citrus herbs has always been a challenging task due to their similar morphological characteristics and the diversity of the multi-components existed in the complicated matrix. In the present investigation, we developed a novel strategy to characterize and classify seven Citrus herbs based on chromatographic analysis and chemometric methods. Firstly, the chemical constituents in seven Citrus herbs were globally characterized by liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC–QTOF-MS). Based on their retention time, UV spectra and MS fragmentation behavior, a total of 75 compounds were identified or tentatively characterized in these herbal medicines. Secondly, a segmental monitoring method based on LC-variable wavelength detection was developed for simultaneous quantification of ten marker compounds in these Citrus herbs. Thirdly, based on the contents of the ten analytes, genetic algorithm optimized support vector machines (GA-SVM) was employed to differentiate and classify the 64 samples covering these seven herbs. The obtained classifier showed good prediction performance and the overall prediction accuracy reached 96.88\%. The proposed strategy is expected to provide new insight for authentication and quality control of traditional herbs.},

This paper focuses on the problem of selecting those sound-describing features that make the vehicle classifier work properly. In particular, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel feature selection method based on a special class of Genetic Algorithm (with restricted search) hybridized with a Extreme Learning Machine. Because of its great generalization performance at a very fast learning speed, the Extreme Learning Machine plays the key role of providing the fitness of candidate solutions in each generation of the Genetic Algorithm. After a number of experiments comparing its performance to that of other fast learning algorithms, our approach has been found to be the most feasible for the application at hand. The proposed method helps the Extreme Learning Machine-based classifier to increase its performance from a mean probability of correct classification of 74.83\% (with no feature selection) up to 93.74\% (when using the optimum subset of selected features).},

	abstract = {Among numerous artificial intelligence approaches, k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks are considered as the most common and effective methods in classification problems in numerous studies. In the present study, the results of the implementation of a novel hybrid feature selection-classification model using the above mentioned methods are presented. The purpose is benefitting from the synergies obtained from combining these technologies for the development of classification models. Such a combination creates an opportunity to invest in the strength of each algorithm, and is an approach to make up for their deficiencies. To develop proposed model, with the aim of obtaining the best array of features, first, feature ranking techniques such as the Fisher's discriminant ratio and class separability criteria were used to prioritize features. Second, the obtained results that included arrays of the top-ranked features were used as the initial population of a genetic algorithm to produce optimum arrays of features. Third, using a modified k-Nearest Neighbor method as well as an improved method of backpropagation neural networks, the classification process was advanced based on optimum arrays of the features selected by genetic algorithms. The performance of the proposed model was compared with thirteen well-known classification models based on seven datasets. Furthermore, the statistical analysis was performed using the Friedman test followed by post-hoc tests. The experimental findings indicated that the novel proposed hybrid model resulted in significantly better classification performance compared with all 13 classification methods. Finally, the performance results of the proposed model was benchmarked against the best ones reported as the state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of classification accuracy for the same data sets. The substantial findings of the comprehensive comparative study revealed that performance of the proposed model in terms of classification accuracy is desirable, promising, and competitive to the existing state-of-the-art classification models.},

	abstract = {Credit scoring methods have been widely investigated by researchers; recently, genetic algorithms have attracted particular attention. Many research papers comparing the performance of genetic algorithms and traditional scoring techniques have been published, but most do not provide enough detail about the fitness function used by the genetic algorithm—despite the fact that fitness function has a key influence on the model’s overall performance. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the predictive performance of different fitness functions used by genetic algorithms in credit scoring. An alternative fitness function based on a variable bitmask is proposed, and its performance then compared with fitness functions based on a polynomial equation as well as an estimation of parameter range. The results suggest that the bitmask is superior to the two other methods in both accuracy and sensitivity. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs sign rank test and paired t-Test indicate these results are statistically significant.},

	abstract = {Pattern clustering and classification can be viewed as a search for, and labeling of a set of inherent clusters in any given data set. This approach can be divided broadly into two types namely supervised and unsupervised clustering. Motivated by human perception and Kohonen's method, we present a novel method of supervised clustering and classification using genetic algorithms. Clusters in the pattern space can be approximated by ellipses or sets of ellipses in two dimensions and ellipsoids in general, and the search for clusters can be approximated as the search for ellipsoids or sets of ellipsoids. By assigning fuzzy membership values to points in the pattern space a fuzzy ellipsoid is obtained. The process of thresholding which follows can be thought of as warping the contour of the ellipse to include and exclude certain points in pattern space and in effect producing an arbitrarily shaped cluster. Here we examine the use of genetic algorithms in generating fuzzy ellipsoids for learning the separation of the classes. Our evaluation function drives the genetic search towards the smallest ellipsoid or set of ellipsoids, which maximizes the number of correctly classified examples, and minimizes the number of misclassified examples.},

This makes it a multi-objective optimization problem that is very difficult to solve efficiently. We have proposed a multi-objective genetic algorithm with a hybrid crossover operator for optimizing these objectives simultaneously. We have compared our rule discovery procedure with simple genetic algorithm with a weighted sum of all these objectives. The experimental result confirms that our rule discovery algorithm has a clear edge over simple genetic algorithm.},

This allows for the creation of a larger and more varied image database, and also artificially increases the difficulty of the classification problem. Application to the CEDAR database of hand-written characters yields both an increase in reliability and an elimination of over-fitting relative to the original CellNet project.},

	abstract = {Classification of land-cover information using remotely-sensed imagery is a challenging topic due to the complexity of landscapes and the spatial and spectral resolution of the images being used. Early studies of land-cover classification used statistical methods such as the maximum likelihood classifier. Recently, however, numerous studies have applied artificial intelligence techniques – for example, expert system, artificial neural networks and support vector machines – as alternatives to remotely-sensed image classification applications. There is a major drawback in applying these models that the user cannot readily realize the final rules. In this paper, a rule-based classifier derived from improved genetic algorithm approach is proposed to determine the knowledge rules for land-cover classification done automatically from remote sensing image datasets. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated for two image datasets classification problems. Results are compared to other approaches in the literatures. The preliminary results indicate that the proposed GA rule-based approach for land-cover classification is promising.},

Here we report an expert system, which utilizes this knowledge base, for predicting localization sites of proteins only from the information on the amino acid sequence and the source origin. We collected data for 401 eukaryotic proteins with known localization sites (subcellular and extracellular) and divided them into training data and testing data. Fourteen localization sites were distinguished for animal cells and 17 for plant cells. When sorting signals were not well characterized experimentally, various sequence features were computationally derived from the training data. It was found that 66\% of the training data and 59\% of the testing data were correctly predicted by our expert system.

The system's FHR baseline was compared with an average of three experts' estimates, and the difference was under 8 bpm in all cases. A fair to good agreement was found with experts' identification of accelerations, decelerations, contractions, and normal/reduced variability (proportions of agreement 0.64-0.89). In a preliminary validity study (n = 85), a sensitivity of 100\% and a specificity of 99\% were obtained in prediction of poor neonatal outcome. The system is currently undergoing an international multicentre validation study.Conclusions: Although still at the research level, a considerable experience has now been gathered with this system. Promising results have been achieved in studies comparing SisPorto with experts' analysis and in those evaluating the validity of the system.},

	abstract = {Tonal harmony analysis is a sophisticated task. It combines general knowledge with contextual cues, and it is concerned with faceted and evolving objects such as musical language, execution style and taste. We present Breve, a system for performing a particular kind of harmony analysis, chord recognition: music is encoded as a sequence of sounding events and the system should assing the appropriate chord label to each event. The solution proposed to the problem relies on a conditional model, where domain knowledge is encoded in the form of Boolean features. Breve exploits the recently proposed algorithm CarpeDiem to obtain significant computational gains in solving the optimization problem underlying the classification process. The implemented system has been validated on a corpus of chorales from J.S. Bach: we report and discuss the learnt weights, point out the committed errors, and elaborate on the correlation between errors and growth in the classification times in places where the music is less clearly asserted.},

In this paper, we propose a new measure, i.e. confusion entropy, for evaluating classifiers.

The proposed measure exploits the class distribution information of such misclassifications of all classes.

	abstract = {Predicted assignments of biological sequences are often evaluated by Matthews correlation coefficient. However, Matthews correlation coefficient applies only to cases where the assignments belong to two categories, and cases with more than two categories are often artificially forced into two categories by considering what belongs and what does not belong to one of the categories, leading to the loss of information. Here, an extended correlation coefficient that applies to K-categories is proposed, and this measure is shown to be highly applicable for evaluating prediction of RNA secondary structure in cases where some predicted pairs go into the category “unknown” due to lack of reliability in predicted pairs or unpaired residues. Hence, predicting base pairs of RNA secondary structure can be a three-category problem. The measure is further shown to be well in agreement with existing performance measures used for ranking protein secondary structure predictions.
